"""
gazette_data.py â€” fetches ESPN week data and assembles context for DocxTPL.

Exports:
- fetch_week_from_espn(league, year, week)
- assemble_context(league_id:str, year:int, week:int, llm_blurbs:bool=False, blurb_style:str="sabre")
- build_context = assemble_context  (back-compat)

This file is tolerant: it renders even if ESPN hides starters; it still emits
HOME_SCORE / AWAY_SCORE so your tables and Spotlight fallbacks work.
